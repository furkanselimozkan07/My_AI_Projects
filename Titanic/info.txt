Students will be separated into two groups & able to truly practice their skills, emphasizing on visualization & modeling with machine learning, with a live Kaggle competition. During this time working with others, students will also be encouraged to identify the gaps in their skills, especially in analysis & modeling, in the project & review as much as possible moving forward to other projects in the continual sessions.
